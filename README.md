# FeelingAnalysisTweet

## Work for information retrieval discipline

-> Implement (in python) a collector that requests and collects data through an API such as: Twitter API, Github, Linkedin, Facebook. And it extracts some information, presenting a report of conclusions about the extracted data.

-> The collection / extraction must have an objective and the same must be clear. The objective should not be just to collect, but to present some analysis with some justification for this and the relevance of that analysis.

-> Perform unit tests for each function implemented

-> Generating a Jupyter report there will be:

    - Contextualization of the definition of the collection objective

    - Justification and relevance of this collection (why is it important?)

    - Presentation of the analysis and its conclusions. You must use APIs to display graphics such as: Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib.

The implementation code must be readable:

-> Name of variables / functions that make their function clear in code

-> Well commented code

-> Code well divided into functions / classes
