Using society analyzes makes us prepared and better understand how the population is reacting, so this work aims to analyze society using the social network twitter in the last 30 days to know the position of people who use the hashtag bolsonaro."

    "The results were not as assertive as expected, on average, 60% of the twitters managed to be analyzed, and of these, a smaller portion still had high accuracy, this is mainly due to the translation that reduced the reliability of the analysis.\n",
